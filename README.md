## Welcome to Critterpedia Lite! ##

This lightweight project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I wanted to see how far I could take interactions with a simple API call without the need for additional frameworks or libraries (like Redux).

This app leverages the [AnimalCrossing API](http://acnhapi.com/) RESTFUL API to help users discover **fish, bugs, and sea creatures** currently available in their hemisphere. Users can filter by hemisphere and type. Looking for a specific critter? Just use the dynamic search feature.

## Run This App Locally

Clone the project and, from the root folder, run: 
### `npm start`

This will run the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

There are no installed dependencies, so you're all set.

🐞 Happy critter hunting! 🐛
